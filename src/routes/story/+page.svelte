			<p>
				Although Lauren and Jason grew up just 10 minutes apart and attended the same university for
				their undergraduate studies, their paths didn’t cross until graduate school. It was there,
				in shared classes and seminars, that their conversations began. Then, on a sunny summer day,
				Lauren stopped by Jason’s place for some ice cream—and that simple moment marked the
				beginning of something truly special.

			<br />

				During the COVID pandemic, Lauren and Jason welcomed their first dog into their lives,
				adding a bundle of joy to their journey. They navigated a few years of long-distance love
				while Lauren moved to Los Angeles for residency and Jason completed graduate school. Now
				reunited in New York City—the greatest city in the world—they’re building a life together
				and eagerly looking forward to their next big adventure.
